Maybe you will have to install "ipaddress" library.

Open your terminal and write:
pip3 install ipaddress

Auto-generator of IP Address. You have to find the correct Network Address, Broadcast Address, and the Subnet Mask.

Possibility to quit if you are stuck with an ip address by typing the letter N, or exit the program by typing the letter Q at any time.
